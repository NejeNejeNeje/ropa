# ROPA — User Guide
> **Version 1.0** — Swap clothes, connect with travelers, and pack lighter.

ROPA is designed to solve a simple backpacker problem: **changing climates, limited space, and fashion fatigue.** Instead of throwing clothes away or buying new ones in every city, ROPA lets you swap with travelers near you.

## 🧭 Core Flows

### 1. The Swipe Feed (`/feed`)
The heart of ROPA. Here you discover clothes from travelers in your current city.
*   **Like (Right Swipe / ♥️):** If you like an item, swipe right. If it's a "Free" item and they swipe back on your profile, it's a Match!
*   **Offer (for Paid items):** If the item has a price, swiping right opens the **Offer Sheet**. You can match the price, underbid (📉), or overbid (🔥). The seller has 24h to accept.
*   **Super Like (⭐):** Immediately signals high interest.
*   **Filter:** Tap the ⚙️ icon to filter by Category, Size, Gender, Condition, and Price.

### 2. Matching & Chat (`/matches` & `/chat/[id]`)
*   **Matches Tab:** See all pending offers and accepted matches.
*   **Chat:** Once matched, the chat opens. It features live polling, read receipts (✓✓), and real-time messaging.
*   **Meetup Coordination:** Use the chat to coordinate. Once agreed, tap **📍 Set Meetup** to drop a pin. This generates smart links to Google Maps/Apple Maps for both parties.
*   **Completion:** After the swap, tap `Complete` on the match card. Both users earn +20 Karma points and are added as official **Swap Buddies**.

### 3. Creating a Listing (`/listing/new`)
Got something to trade? 
1.  Tap the `+ Sell` icon.
2.  Add a title, condition, and category.
3.  Choose your pricing: **Free** (🎁), **Fixed** (💰), or **Negotiable** (🤝).
4.  Your city and country are auto-filled so travelers nearby can find you.

### 4. Explore (`/explore`)
Beyond 1-on-1 swaps, ROPA connects you to the broader travel community:
*   **📍 Drop Zones:** Partner hostels and coworking spaces with physical "Swap Shelves". Browse what's currently there before you visit.
*   **🔄 Swap Circles:** Group swap events happening in your city. RSVP to secure your spot.
*   **🌍 Community Feed:** Travel stories and styling inspiration from the network.

## 🛡️ Trust & Safety (SwapShield)

Swapping with strangers requires trust. ROPA uses **SwapShield**:
*   **Verification:** Profiles are tied to verified sign-ins.
*   **Trust Tiers:** Users start at Bronze 🟤, move to Silver ⚪ after 5 completed trades, and Gold 🟡 after 20.
*   **Ratings:** Every completed swap allows a rating, building your public reputation.
